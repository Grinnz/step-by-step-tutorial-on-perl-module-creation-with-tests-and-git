First of all thanks!

All contributions will be accepted for the material under this [source](source) folder: the markdown document 
meant to be viewed by tutorial audience will be generated from the [html page](source/tutorial-english.html) contained under [source](source).

The code of the module presented is by choice extremely simple: I do not plan to change it.

By other hand every correction in the testing process, or in the git phase will be welcome.

Markdown is not rended always as I intended (even if html is correct): it has some weird render in the [tutorial-english.md](../tutorial/tutorial-english.md)

Being english not my mother tongue language, any english correction will be welcome too.

Transaltions will be gladly accepted.
